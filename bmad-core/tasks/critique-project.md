# Critique Project Task

## Purpose

- To perform a comprehensive analysis of the entire project codebase.
- To identify areas of improvement in code quality, architecture, and overall structure.
- To provide a detailed report with actionable recommendations.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Understand the Project

- Use the `document-project` task to get a comprehensive overview of the project.
- Analyze the project's structure, dependencies, and main components.

### 2. Analyze Code Quality

- Scan the codebase for code smells, anti-patterns, and bad practices.
- Check for code duplication.
- Evaluate code complexity and readability.
- Check for adherence to coding standards defined in `technical-preferences.md`.

### 3. Evaluate Architecture

- Assess the project's architecture for scalability, maintainability, and resilience.
- Check for tight coupling and low cohesion.
- Evaluate the separation of concerns.
- Compare the architecture with known best practices and architectural patterns.

### 4. Check Dependencies

- Analyze `package.json` and other dependency files.
- Check for outdated dependencies.
- Look for known vulnerabilities in the used libraries.

### 5. Generate Report

- Create a detailed report summarizing the findings.
- For each issue, provide:
    - A clear description of the problem.
    - Code snippets or examples.
    - An explanation of why it is a problem.
    - Actionable recommendations for how to fix it.
- Structure the report into sections: Code Quality, Architecture, Dependencies.
